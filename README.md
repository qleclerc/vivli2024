This repository contains the code for our project submitted to the Vivli 2024 AMR Data Challenge.
This repository is based on research using data from Pfizer, Paratek, Venatorx, Shionogi, obtained through https://amr.vivli.org. 

<br/>

**Note**: The raw industry surveillance datasets were obtained via Vivli and are not included in this repository. The `prepare_data.R` script requires these datasets to be present in a folder named "raw", placed in the "data" folder.

We have included in the "data" folder the combined dataset `final_AMR_dataset.csv` for *E. coli* and *K. pneumoniae* resistance to six classes of antibiotics, as presented in our report.
